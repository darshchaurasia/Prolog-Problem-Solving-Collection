# Prolog Problem Solving Collection

## Description

This project consists of a collection of Prolog solutions that address various problem-solving tasks. The solutions showcase the power of logic programming and the declarative approach of Prolog, making them ideal for tasks such as family tree analysis, game solving, sorting algorithms, and mathematical operations.

## Features

- Solutions implemented in Prolog for a variety of problems.
- Emphasis on logic programming and declarative problem solving.
- Modular and reusable code structure.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/prolog-problem-solving.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd prolog-problem-solving
    ```

3. Run the Prolog files using:
    ```bash
    swipl -s <filename>.pl
    ```

## Usage

1. Execute the Prolog scripts using SWI-Prolog or any compatible Prolog interpreter:
    ```bash
    swipl -s <filename>.pl
    ```

2. Interact with the program according to the problem requirements or input queries directly.
